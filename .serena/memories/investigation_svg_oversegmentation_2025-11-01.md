2025-11-01: Investigated smoke test SVG over-segmentation. Root causes: JPEG fixture has ~500 unique colors due to compression noise; Quantizer K-means default (20 clusters) splits near-duplicate reds; ShapeLayerBuilder noise thresholds default to zero so tiny clusters persist. Suggested mitigations include switching fixture to lossless image, tuning cluster/noise thresholds, or enabling Gaussian smoothing.
